## Java Spring Boot for Beginners

A tutorial on developing a web application in the backend using Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

There will be no UI but using Postman to ensure API calls are correct.

### The project

We are building a quiz service application, on which a user will get 10 multiple choice questions, and they will atempt to answer them all.
At the end, the user will get a score based on the correct number of answers.

We will use PostgreSQL as a database to store the questions and related answers.
We will have a simple Java Spring Boot application with a CRUD structure (CREATE question, READ question, UPDATE question, DELETE question)
