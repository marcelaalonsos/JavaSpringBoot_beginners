NOTES

1. SPRING INITIALIZER
- go to start.spring.io
- select Maven as a Project, and Java as a language
- select Spring Boot version 3.1.2
- Metadata:
group: com.telusko
artifact: quizapp
description: Telusko Quiz App

- select JAR for packaging
- select Java 17
- for dependencies:
Spring web
PostgreSQL Driver
Spring Data JPA
Lombok

- click generate and it will download a zip folder
- open folder in IDE

2. PostgreSQL database
- open pgAdmin4 to enable PostgreSQL use
- create a new database called questiondb
- create a table called question
- add 6 columns id(as pk), category, difficultylevel, option1, option2, option3
- in the properties of the id column, in constraints, select primary key and not null to yes, and in the type select identity, identity as always, and increment 1
- each column has the following type: integer, character varying,  character varying, character varying, character varying, character varying
- to add rows into the table, right click on the table and select scripts/ insert scripts
- because the id is primary key and auto increments, we can delete the first ?, then fill in the rest with the required data

3. create the question controller
- in src/main/java/com/telusko/quizapp is where we will create the REST controller
- create a new class Called QuestionController
- in the header annotate @RESTController and @RequestMapping("question")
- inside the class, we will create a method to get all the questions
- annotate the method with @GetMapping("allQuestions)
- the method for now will return a string
public String getAllQuestions() {
  return "Hi, These are your questions";
}

- in the resources folder, we will edit the application properties
- add the following code:
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/questiondb
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=admin
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

4. fetch the questions from the db
- in the QuestionController file, inside the class we are going to the return the service layer from the method
- make a reference to the service by adding QuestionService questionService inside the class before all the methods
- annotate that reference with @Autowired
- note that the service returns an entity with is a model
- the getAllQuestions method returns a List<Question> question is the model we created


5. Question model class
- in the project folder, create a file called Question.java
- this will be our model, and will have properties that match the columns of the table in the database
- for the id property, we need to annotate it as @Id so it know it is a primary key, and @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
- annotate the class as @Entity, and @Data

6. Question service class
- in the service class, annotate the class as @Service so the framework knows how to handle it
- inside the class, create a method that will fetch all the questions
- before the method, create a reference to the Dao (Repository) QuestionDao questionDao; and annotate it as @Autowired
- the method returns question.findAll();

7. Question Dao
- create a file called QuestionDao.java in the project folder
- annotate @Repository in the header of the file
- the interface should extends JpaRepository, the JpaRepository asks for 2 things, 1. is the object we are working with - in this case Question, and 2. what is the kind of primary key, which is an integer:
public interface QuestionDao extends JpaRepository<Question, Integer> {
}

8. Fetching questions by category
- in the question controller, create a @GetMapping("category/{category}) method called getQuestionsByCategory(@PathVariable String category)
- the method will return a method from the question service of the same name, passing category as an argument
- in the question service file we'll create a method of the same name that will return a query from the dao file
  public List<Question> getQuestionsByCategory(String category) {
    return questionDao.findByCategory(category);
  }
- however, since we're fetching from a column and not a primary key, we'll have to create a custom method in the dao file
- in the dao file, inside the interface, we return List<Question> findByCategory(String category);

9. Adding a question
- in the question controller file, we will add a method to addQuestion
- as a paremeter, the method will take Question question -which is the model
- it should be annotated as @RequestBody because you are requesting the data from the body
- how do we add it to the database? well, we have a method in the questionService called addQuestion
- it should return questionService.addQuestion(question);
- before the method, it should be annotated with @PostMapping("add")

10. addQuestion method in the service
  public String addQuestion(Question question) {
    questionDao.save(question);
    return "success";
  }
- .save is a built in method from the dao
